# Advent of code 2023 (GOLANG)

This repository serves as my playground for learning GoLang through the puzzles offered by [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) (shoutout to Eric Wastl!).

The code within is a product of my ongoing learning journey. While it functions, there's ample room for improvement through refactoring and testing. I plan to revisit and enhance it as I deepen my understanding of GoLang.

At this stage, these puzzles serve as an invaluable practical resource, enabling me to grasp the nuances of the language.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback as I evolve my proficiency in GoLang with these challenges.
